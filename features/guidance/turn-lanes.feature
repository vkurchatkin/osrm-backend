Feature: Turn Lane Guidance

    Background:
        Given the profile "car"
        Given a grid size of 30 meters

    #requires https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues/417
    #Due to this, we use & as a pipe character. Switch them out for \| when 417 is fixed

            | nodes | name  | turn:lanes:forward  | oneway |
            | ab    | road  | left\|through;right | no     |
            | bcd   | road  |                     | no     |
            | eb    | owi   |                     | yes    |
            | cf    | turn  |                     | no     |
            | bg    | right |                     | no     |

        When I route I should get
            | waypoints | route            | turns                    | lanes |
            | a,f       | road,turn,turn   | depart,turn left,arrive  | ,1,   |
            | a,g       | road,right,right | depart,turn right,arrive | ,0,   |

    Scenario: Passing a one-way street, partly pulled back lanes, no through
        Given the node map
            | e |   |   | f |
            | a |   | b | c |
            |   |   | g |   |

        And the ways
            | nodes | name  | turn:lanes:forward  | oneway |
            | ab    | road  | left\|right         | no     |
            | bc    | road  |                     | no     |
            | eb    | owi   |                     | yes    |
            | cf    | turn  |                     | no     |
            | bg    | right |                     | no     |

        When I route I should get
            | waypoints | route            | turns                    | lanes |
            | a,f       | road,turn,turn   | depart,turn left,arrive  | ,1,   |
            | a,g       | road,right,right | depart,turn right,arrive | ,0,   |
